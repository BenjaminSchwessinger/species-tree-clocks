# Background

This tutorial introduces StarBEAST2, and update to \*BEAST which is more than
10x faster and implements species tree relaxed clocks. These new clock models
enable researchers to estimate substitution rates for individual species,
and to infer where shifts in rates of molecular evolution have occured.
